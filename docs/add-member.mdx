## How to join a DAO or add a new member

Different DAOs have different membership requirements. Typically, you'll submit a Membership Proposal and request Shares and/or Loot depending on their policy, sometimes while adding a tribute.

By default, the person signed in and submitting the proposal will be filled in as the 'Applicant'. If you're submitting the Membership Proposal for someone else, you can click 'Additional Options' > 'Applicant', and then input their address instead of your own.
