## What is a CCO

A CCO is a term we’ve come up with to describe the process of a community forming a DAO around a particular project / product in order to support its ongoing development or survival as a community owned resource. CCO stands for “Community Contribution Opportunity.”

A CCO is different from an ICO or DAICO, because it’s all about community and the contributions don’t have to take the form of money or ETH. The end result of a CCO is a product managed by a community rather than a small team and their investors.
