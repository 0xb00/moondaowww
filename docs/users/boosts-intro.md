### What are Boosts? 
Boosts are plugins that introduce functionality to your DAOs beyond the core functionalities of treasury, shares, loots and proposals. You can think of them like apps for iOS devices, plugins for Shopify shops. 


### Boosts Marketplace

The Boosts Marketplace is a marketplace where you can discover and install new Boosts to better manage your DAO. Current categories of Boosts are Payments, Community, Governance, NFTs and Dev Tools 

To get to your Boosts Marketplace, click on rocket icon ('Boosts'). You will be able to see your installed boosts in the 'Installed' tab, as well as discover new boosts in the 'Market' tab.

### How do Boosts & Minions work together? 

On the 'Installed tab', you can view your installed Boosts and Minions. Boosts that require smart contract interactions will require a Minion to be summoned. 

> For a recap, Minions enable your DAO to call arbitrary contracts, enabling you to do many things such as manage ENS, collect NFTs, manage treasury in DeFi, etc.

To further explain the relationship between Boosts and Minions, refer to the table below. 

|     | Boost Types                                         | Requires Minion? | Example                                |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Boosts that do not have smart contract interactions | No               | Discord Notifications, Discourse Forum |
| 2   | Boosts that have smart contract interactions        | Yes              | Superfluid                                       |

For Boosts that require a Minon, the installation steps will bring you through summoning a Minion and setting up your Boosts.
