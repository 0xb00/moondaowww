## DAOhaus works on multiple networks beyond Ethereum mainnet.

These guides should help you get setup and interacting with your DAO on networks other than Ethereum mainnet. Typically all you need to do is setup Metamask for a network and know where to bridge tokens. Everything else acts the same as Mainnet, except a whole lot cheaper and faster, allowing for wider participation.
