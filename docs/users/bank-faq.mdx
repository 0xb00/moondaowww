<h4><details>
  <summary>Q: How should I send and store ERC20 tokens in my DAO contract?</summary>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
A: You should whitelist the tokens via a Whitelist proposal and click on "Sync" on the treasury page. After that when you send the tokens to your DAO address, the tokens should appear in the bank.

 <h4><details>
  <summary>Q: I am redploying my DAO and need to transfer funds from one DAO to the other. How should I do it?</summary>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
A: Do not send the funds directly to the DAO address. 

The first approach is to claim the balances from the old DAO and provide tribute in the new DAO to deposit the funds. 

The second approach is to transfer funds to a Minion and use the Minion to send the funds. 

Do not send funds to your new DAO address via a funding proposal as the contract is merely updating the internal balances, which members or minions should ideally withdraw later on. Your funds will be lost.
