### What are wrapped tokens and why do I need them?

Native tokens like ETH on Ethereum Mainnet or xDAI on the xDAI network are special as they're the only token accepted for transaction fees on the respective network. Because of that, they can be tricky and expensive to work with. So DAOs and a lot of their dapps use wrapped versions of those tokens. wETH is wrapped ETH, wxDAI is wrapped xDAI, and so on.

The folks at Raid Guild have built a no fees, no frills simple wrapper at https://wrapeth.com. You can wrap and unwrap at anytime.
