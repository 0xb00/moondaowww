## Bank (or Treasury)

The bank is the core inventory of the DAO and can hold up to 200 different ERC-20 tokens. All members share direct ownership of the bank based on their Shares and/or Loot in relation to one another.

Example simple DAO, assuming a bank with 600 DAI

| Member | Shares | Loot | Voting Power | Exit Value |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Alice  | 10     | 0    | 25%          | 100 DAI    |
| Bob    | 10     | 10   | 25%          | 200 DAI    |
| Chris  | 20     | 0    | 50%          | 200 DAI    |
| Dani   | 0      | 10   | 0%           | 100 DAI    |

Shares grant **voting power** as well as exit value, whereas Loot only grants exit value. Thus, Bob has 25% of voting power (Shares), but 33% of the exit value (total Shares + Loot). Dani has no Shares, thus no voting power, but with 10 Loot, still has 16% of Exit Value.
