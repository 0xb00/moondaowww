  <h4><details>
  
  <summary>Q: Is there a test / staging area for creating DAOs?</summary>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
A: Yes, DAOhaus is on Rinkeby and Kovan. It is also really cheap to test on xDAI.

  <summary>Q: What is "Dilution Bound" in Hard Mode settings when summoning a DAO?</summary>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
A: Dilution bound is a mechanism to handle edge cases where many members RageQuit, increasing the dilution of non-ragequit members. 
This hasn't been used before, but 3 is usually good.

  <summary>Q: What is "Processing Reward"?</summary>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
A: The processing reward is a mechanism to incentivize members to actively process proposals and keep the proposal funnel clear.

  <summary>Q: There is no explicit setting for proposal velocity in Hard Mode. Where is it?</summary>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

A: In Hard Mode, the voting period is equal to the proposal velocity.  So, at a default of 7200 seconds, it is 2 hours. If mutiple proposals are submitted at the same time, one proposal will enter into voting every 2 hours (first in, first out).  Therefore, with a shorter voting period you raise the upper limit for proposal velocity in your DAO.

  <summary>Q: Can I change the proposal velocity / voting period after creating the DAO?</summary>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  A: Unfortunately, no. The alternative would be to upgrade your DAO, clone the members / shares and transfer the balances over to the new DAO.

  <summary>Q: Can I customise the font and colours of my DAO theme?</summary>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  A: Yes, you can customise the font and colours of your DAO theme through the "Custom Theme" app

  <summary>Q: I'm setting up a Grants DAO. Is there a recommended number of share per summoner to start with?</summary>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  A: An arbitrary rule of thumb is to have more than 1, so keeping it to 10 would be a good start. 

  It is also helpful to set a minimum / maximum for members, as well as loot for whales. For instance, if 1 share is estimted to be 0.1 ETH, each member can have minimum 10, maximum 100 shares.

  For whales who want to add more than 10 ETH (i.e. >100 shares), they would be allocated loot instead of shares. 

  This makes the DAO fair and functional for members, and whales.
