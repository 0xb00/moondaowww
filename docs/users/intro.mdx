## What is DAOhaus?

DAOhaus is a no-code platform for launching and running DAOs. Is it owned and operated by the community itself. All DAOs on the platform utilize the glorious open-source code of [Moloch](/docs/users/intro-moloch)

### Who is this documentation for?

This documentation is to help users utilize the platform. We have a great new foundation in V2, with loads of new features now rolling out. We'll do our best to keep pace with rapid development.

> For more developer-focused documentation, head to [devs](/docs/devs)

### Support beyond the documentation

Feel free to hit us up in our #Support Channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CAqTnwGpez). Let us know any bugs you find, requests for new features, or just ask us anything about daos.
