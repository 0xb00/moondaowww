### Membership

Request or allocate Shares and Loot to new or existing members.

### Funding

Request tokens from the DAO

### Token

Approve a new token for the DAO. Only approved tokens can be accepted or used by the DAO.

### Trade

Trade tokens with the DAO. Your tokens in, DAO tokens out.

### GuildKick

Kick a member.

## Advanced Proposal Types

### Minion

Minion proposals allow DAOs to build transactions to interact with external contracts. _More info forthcoming_
