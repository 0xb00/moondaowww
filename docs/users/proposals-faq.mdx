### Sponsoring of Proposals

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: I want to sponsor a proposal, but I'm unable to do so as the button is
      greyed out
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Check to make sure you have enough wxDAI to sponsor the proposal.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>

  </details>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: What are the rewards for Sponsors vs. Processors of a proposal?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: When a proposal is processed, the sponsor will receive his initial
    deposit minus processing reward. The member who processed the proposal will
    receive the processing reward (set by the DAO).

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: What happens to unsponsored proposals if they are left unsponsored?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: If proposals are left unsponsored, you will not see them in the UI after approximately 2 weeks. 
  </details>
</h4>

### Voting & Passing of Proposals

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Are proposals passed according to number of members or shares voted for
      the proposal?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: The proposal will pass as long as majority of votes go to either "Yes" or
    "No". The number of members voting for a proposal is usually secondary and
    triggered only in extreme cases.
  </details>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Does voting on proposals cost gas, or is it just signing?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: It costs gas, but it should only require 1 yes vote if there is soft
    consensus achieved before voting.
  </details>
</h4>


<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: What is the rough cost of submitting, approving, processing a proposal
      on Mainnet??
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: It's around ~$100 (That said, this is context and time dependent during
    the time of this Q&A).
  </details>
</h4>


<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: If a proposal has passed, is there any way to reverse or change the
      vote?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: If the proposal has been passed by majority of votes, there is no way to
    reverse the proposal. However, if the proposal is in "Voting", you can
    persuade other members to vote "No" to prevent the proposal from passing.
  </details>
</h4>


### Grace Period & Processing of Proposals



<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: The majority of the DAO has voted to pass a proposal. Why do I have to
      wait?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: After a proposal has passed from voting, the DAO has to wait for the
    voting and grace period to pass before processing the proposal. The
    durations for these are set when you summon your DAO. You can also set a
    "Quorum Threshold" so that the voting period is shortened with consensus.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Must proposals be sequentially processed? i.e. one before another
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Yes.
  </details>
</h4>


<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: If a prospective member submits a member proposal with tribute, gets it
      approved, proposal enters the grace period, and the prospect Rage Quits
      before the grace period ends, what will happen to their tribute?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: If their shares are more than the dilution bound setting (e.g. 1/3), the
    proposal would fail when they rage quit. When a member submits a membership
    proposal, their tribute goes into the escrow and goes into the treasury only
    when the proposal is passed and processed. If the member rage quits before
    the processing, they can only take their current fair share of the treasury.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: My proposal has failed. Does this mean that it was not processed?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: After the voting period has ended, when a proposal is ready to be
    processed, you will see whether or not the proposal passed/failed. If no one
    voted on the proposal, it will automatically fail. It will also fail if the
    action outlined in the proposal cannot be executed, such as sending 500
    wxDAI from your DAO to an Externally Owned Account (EOA), when your DAO
    doesn't actually hold 500 wxDAI.
  </details>
</h4>


<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: Why do proposal stages in different DAOs have different time intervals (e.g. 10 minutes vs 1 hour)? </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: This depends on the period duration that was set up during the summoning of the DAO. If an interval of 1 hour was chosen, a sponsored proposal will go into the queue and go for voting in the period of 1 hour.
  </details>
</h4> 

## Funding Proposals

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: Can I make a Funding Proposal for a non-member?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Yes you can, when filling out the details of the proposal, enter the
    address you want funds sent to in the field `applicant address`.
