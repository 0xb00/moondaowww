## How to request funding from a DAO

Within the DAO, navigate to Proposals and submit a Funding Proposal. Every community is unique, so check with them on how they'd like you to fill out the title, description and link for the proposal.

If your proposal passes, the funds will be available to withdraw from your internal balance, found in your profile within the DAO.

> **Important!** Make sure the 'Applicant' is an ethereum address you control, like _not a Coinbase wallet_, as you'll need to withdraw the tokens if/when the proposal passes. Gnosis Safes are okay as well, though require a bit of advanced transaction building magic, so only really advanced users who know _exactly what they're doing_ should use one. Otherwise, **THE FUNDS WILL BE LOST FOREVER!**
