## What are wrapped tokens and why do I need them?

Native tokens like ETH on Ethereum Mainnet or xDAI on the xDAI network are special as they're the only token accepted for transaction costs on the respective network. Because of that, they can tricky and expensive to transfer. So DAOs and a lot of ther dapps use wrapped versions of those tokens. wETH is wrapped ETH, wxDAI is wrapped xDAI, and so on.

The folks at Raid Guild have build a no fees, no frills simple wrapper at https://wrapeth.com
