- Include all dependencies in the dependency array
- If logic inside of a useEffect calls a function, either:
  - have that function call a useCallback and include each dependency of that function in the useCallback's dep-array
  - include the function inside of the useEffect itself
  - Or refactor the function to outide the component
- Do not force the useEffect to run. Istead have the useEffect listen to the dependency and render accordingly.
- Check to see how often the useEffect is running. If it sets state or runs complex logic, create guards to escape if it doesn't need to run.
- If the useEffect sets a value in state based on synchronous props, consider using useMemo to save that value directly inside the component instead.
- Always unsubscribe from listeners
- Unsubscribe from asynchronous calls (not currently implemented)
