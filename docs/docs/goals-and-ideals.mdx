- Organize the app to make it easier to debug, maintain, and integrate new functionality
- Create a common code paradigm used by all devs on the team.
- Share the rules of this paradigm to make it easier for new devs to contribute lasting code.
- Make code more consistent and readable
- Make code easier to debug.

### Overarching Ideals

- Less code. Perform the greatest amount of work with the least amount of expression.
- Less state. Strive to eliminate excess state wherever possible.
- DRY
- Functional is generally preferred over Object Oriented.
- No hard rules. Devs should be free to break any rule at any time. However, if they do wish to break a rule, they should outline their reasoning in a comment.
- Any major changes or new patterns should be posted in #code-review on Discord
- Clean as you go. Devs rarely refactor code months later, despite their best intentions. So it's best to deliver clean code from the outset.
- Criticism and review should be frequent and good-spirited.
- This is an ongoing process. We need to debate and discuss these rules in order to improve them.

### Review Process

- TBD (meeting, Pull request)
