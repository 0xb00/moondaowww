- Organize the app to make it easier to debug, maintain, and integrate new functionality
- Create a common code paradigm used by all devs on the team.
- Share the rules of this paradigm to make it easier for new devs to contribute lasting code.
- Make code more consistent and readable
- Make code easier to debug.

### Overarching Ideals

- Less code. Perform the greatest amount of work with the least amount of expression.
- Less state. Strive to eliminate excess state wherever possible.
- DRY
- Functional is generally preferred over Object Oriented.
- No hard rules. Devs should be free to break any rule at any time. However, if they do wish to break a rule, they should outline their reasoning in a comment.
- Any major changes or new patterns should be posted in #code-review on Discord
- Clean as you go. Devs rarely refactor code months later, despite their best intentions. So it's best to deliver clean code from the outset.
- Criticism and review should be frequent and good-spirited.
- This is an ongoing process. We need to debate and discuss these rules in order to improve them.

### Review Process

- TBD (meeting, Pull request)

### Style guide

Our linter is currently set to adhere to the <a href="https://airbnb.io/javascript/">AirBNB JS Style guide </a>

### New Devs

- To save yourself some time, read through the review guidlines thoroughly
- Learn the structure of the app.
- If you're taksed with interacting with a contract (TXs), learn the TX/polling/test cycle.
- Brush up on React by scouring the docs. Familiarize yourself with some of the more advanced aspects of hooks, contexts, and lazy-loading.
- Make sure your async JS game is on point. If not, that's cool. Take some time to browse some examples in the docs. Check out some tutorials. It gets much easier over time.
