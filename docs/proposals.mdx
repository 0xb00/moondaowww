**1. Submit Proposal**

Anyone, even non-members, can submit proposals to the DAO.

**2. Sponsor Proposal**

Only members can 'Sponsor' the proposal, sending it to the `Queue`

During this period, all members can now vote Yes or No on the proposal.

**5. Grace Period**

Voting is over, and the Proposal is set to pass or fail depending on the votes cast during Voting. Members who voted No, and have no other pending Yes votes, can ragequit during this period

**6. Ready for Processing**

Anyone, even non-members, can now Process the proposal, executing its function.

**7. Completed**

Final resting place of all proposals after processing, either pass or fail.
