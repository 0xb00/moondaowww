### Where are the funds going to be stored?
We will use the same strategy as ConstitutionDAO for the initial fundraise for MoonDAO. We'll store the funds in a Gnosis multi-sig with some of the core contributors, and then use Juicebox's protocol to raise funds. Once we have a coin we will use a snapshot to make decisions as a DAO.

The token represents governance over the assets, but not fractionalized ownership of the space rocks themselves.

### What are the risks?
Crypto and web3 involve emergent and rapidly-developing technology and there is always a risk of unforeseen issues could impact us. Although we feel strongly that we have made everything as secure and foolproof as possible given the time constraints, we feel that itâ€™s important to inform the community that these are possible risks:

1. Despite the many layers of protection we have in place, the Gnosis Multi-Sig wallet could be affected by theft, loss of keys, or fraud.
2. While the community has thoroughly vetted these contracts and our contribution platform has been previously battle-tested with millions of dollars secured, there is always the possibility that a smart contract could be hacked due to an unknown vulnerability.

### Am I receiving ownership in exchange for my contribution?
No. You are receiving a governance token, not fractionalized ownership. Governance includes the ability to advise on (for illustrative purposes) where our space rocks should be displayed, how they should be exhibited, and the mission and values of MoonDAO. MoonDAO is taking donations and donors are receiving governance tokens with no expectation of profit. These donations are not tax deductible at this point in time.

### Will the core team receive any of the raised funds for themselves or get compensated in any way from this?
The core team has not received or pre-minted any tokens. We just want this to exist, we're not doing this for the money. If you want to tip anyone in the community with NFT-memes or give individuals something for their hard work, that's up to you. We don't see much of a distinction between the core-contributors and the rest of the people. Eventually we hope there is no distinction in the long term and the community and core contributors have the same powers.

### How will governance work?
We are looking into using a similar method of governance as the Green Bay Packers. Votes will be proportional to the amount of tokens you have, but capped at 4% of the total vote. This means that the MoonDAO governance will be decentralized.
