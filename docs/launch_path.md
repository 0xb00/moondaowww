1. Create a safe using a Gnosis multi-sig protected via core team signers with Snapshot for voting.
2. Fund the treasury through deployment of MoonDAO tokens via the Juicebox protocol and *Tickets to Space* tiered NFTs
3. Evolve the governance, as needed, from the multi-sig and Snapshot using a DAO platform like DAOhaus or Moloch or Orcha. This would allow for new features such as: ragequitting and spinning up sub-DAOs with budgets received from the main treasury to deploy sub-missions for MoonDAO.
