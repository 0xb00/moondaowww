## Distribution & Tokenomics
1. Our token will have a fixed supply. Once our initial token raise is over, we will never increase the supply of the tokens.

2. Our token will be used for governance decisions. We will have proportional governance up to a community decided limit. The limit is needed so that if one person buys more than 51% of the tokens they cannot centrally control the DAOâ€™s decisions. To begin, we will use a 4% limit of the total coin supply, however anyone is welcome to purchase more than 4% if they would like to contribute more.

3. The money raised from this token will fund the workers (NFT designers, website developers, solidity developers, marketing, legal consulting, etc.) needed to complete the rest of the roadmap.

4. The token raise will occur on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money/#/p/moondao), and for every contribution we will create governance tokens at a fixed rate. You will receive a portion of those tokens in your wallet, and then some will stay with the DAO in order to fund the work required to make this DAO function, and those tokens will form part of the shared treasury that you can vote on with your tokens.

There is no expectation of profit with this token. It is a governance token. You are not receiving fractionalized ownership of the DAOs assets in exchange for the token, check our FAQs for more information and disclaimers.
