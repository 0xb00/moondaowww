## Distribution & Tokenomics
Governance Token MOONEY to be distributed in Lunar phases, with incremental decreases in the reserve rate over time. 

Our funding goal: The primary goal is to decentralize the governance of MoonDAO, but in order to fund our project we need capital. $450,000 gives us enough to purchase at least one ticket, but tickets in auction have gone up to $27 Million dollars. This token raise wonâ€™t be our only opportunity to raise funds, but ideally this token gives us enough runway to achieve Moon phase 2
## Reseve Rate Fluctuation

**Lunar Cycle 0** - launch date **12/17/21 17:00 EST**: reserve rate of 500,000 MOONEY for every 1 ETH donated 

**Lunar Cycle 1** -  **1/18/22 Time TBD**:
reserve rate will decrease by a percentage tbd, by community.
