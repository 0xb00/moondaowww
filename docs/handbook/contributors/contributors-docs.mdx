>Above is an example
>
>**Issue** "Can a DAO member request loot?"
> * **Where in the docs?**:
    >  `Pre-revamp FAQ section` under `Proposals` (i.e. You can click "https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-website/blob/prod/docs/users/proposals-faq.mdx" to access the file directly) 
> * **What help is needed?**:
 Based on the prompt `Yes, under your funding proposal, you can add a field "Loot Requested" to request loot`, create an `answer with screenshots` on requesting loot


**3. Fork the daohaus-website repo**

**4. Create a new branch with the naming convention "feature/issue-`ID` "**
> In the above example, the issue's ID is #24, so the branch should be issue-24

**5. Make the changes on your branch**


**6. Once you are done, commit and push the changes onto issue-`ID` branch on your own repository**

**7. Submit a Pull Request to HausDAO's daohaus-website repository**

**8. Reviewers / moderators will review the changes, ensuring that answers are (1) accurate (2) adhering to our [style guide](https://hackmd.io/vI1_pmTJTmy2_u0U7ZYQbA?both#43-Style-Guide) (below)**

**9. Once both criteria are passed, your changes will be approved, merged and live! ðŸŽ‰**
