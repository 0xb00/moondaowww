    <summary>Q: I tried submitting a PR to the daohaus-app repository, but it says I don't have permissions to make a PR. How can I solve this? </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    First, you need to fork the repository and create the changes on your fork. Next, you should submit a PR from the fork. For a more detailed tutorial on submitting PRs to public repositories, please refer to [this tutorial by Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/).
