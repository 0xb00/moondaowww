## 1. What is DAOhaus?

DAOhaus is a no-code platform for launching and running DAOs. It is owned and operated by the community. All DAOs on the platform utilize the glorious open-source code of [Moloch](https://www.molochdao.com/).

For more information, please refer to DAOhaus documentation: https://daohaus.club/docs/

## 2. Why contribute to DAOhaus documentation? 
Since DAOs are a relatively new phenomena, there are many concepts, steps and processes that are foreign to new DAOhaus users. In order to encourage more DAO-ing in this world, we need to help more people join and summon DAOs. Your help in improving documentation is crucial here. 

Furthermore, the ongoing release of new features by our Magesmiths makes it important for us to tell existing users about new features and how to use them. With clear and detailed documentation, we enable DAO users to do good with DAOhaus features to the fullest extent. 

Hence, for both new and existing users, documentation is espeically crucial in user onboarding and education. 

## 3. How does DAOhaus documentation work? 

DAOhaus documentation is split up into 3 sections: 
* Users : General users of app.daohaus.club
* Handbook: Users who belong to a Discord track (e.g. Contributor, Summoner, etc. )
* Developers: Developers who want to find out more about how DAOhaus works
