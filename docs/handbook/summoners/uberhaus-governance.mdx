## What is UberHaus

[UberHaus](https://uberhaus.club/docs/welcome) is the DAO that governs the DAOhaus platform and ecosystem, including the HAUS token.

DAOhaus is governed by its constituents - DAOs! That means the only members of the UberHaus DAO are DAOs themselves.

To participate in UberHaus governance, DAOs will need to have the HAUS token whitelisted in their DAO.

Watch this space for more details. In the meantime, feel free to visit [UberHaus](https://uberhaus.club/docs/proposal-flow) or drop into the #summoner-track with any questions you may have related to UberHaus, HAUS, or anything else!
