[**👩🏻‍🏫 Scholar Track**](https://discord.gg/YEN6ph4xyx) 
serves the curious folk and ready thinkers who want to learn more about DAOs and the DAOhaus product.

The track will take you through a series of `Getting Started` quests that will advance you through the subsequent levels.  There are currently    `three` levels within the Scholar track

Some sample tasks to get started include summarising any videos of our Haus Parties, completing a Gitcoin quest, researching DAOhaus-related topics.

As you level up, you will unlock more perks such as tips, HAUS rewards, Haus Party stage invites and more! Once you have completed all of the levels, you will be eligible to receive a DAO master certificate NFT.
